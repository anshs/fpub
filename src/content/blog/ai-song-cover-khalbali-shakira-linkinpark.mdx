AI cover of Hindi song "Khalbali" in the voice of Chester Bennington (from Linkin Park) and Shakira. Created using RVC v2. The tricky part was to get the signature Chester "screams" for which I had to train a separate model and later edit the audio in FL studio. 
I have an detailed post and tutorial for [how to create your own AI voice clones using RVC (link)](/posts/ai-song-covers-using-rvc/)
